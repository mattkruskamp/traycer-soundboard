## Chat Log

### 1. User: Create a nextjs project

### 2. Assistant: To create a Next.js project, you need to run the following command in your terminal:

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

This will prompt you for the project name and other options. If you want to specify the project name and use default options, you can run:

```
npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app --use-npm --ts --eslint
```

Replace `my-nextjs-app` with your desired folder name. Would you like instructions for customizing the setup or help with the next steps?

### 3. User: I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

[...truncated for brevity: The full chat log continues with all user requests, plans, verification comments, and assistant responses, including all implementation steps, file changes, and explanations.]

### 4. User: Add a Github Action file that publishes the vite production static site to Github Pages

### 5. Assistant: A GitHub Action workflow file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` has been added. It builds your Vite production site and publishes it to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch.

Let me know if you need any customizations or further CI/CD setup.
